🎓 Student Dropout Prediction System

A machine learning–based system to predict the likelihood of student dropout using academic, demographic, and behavioral data.
The project aims to support early identification of at-risk students and enable timely academic interventions.

📌 Overview

Student dropout is a critical challenge in higher education, impacting both individuals and institutions.
This project applies supervised machine learning techniques to analyze real-world student data and predict dropout risk with high accuracy.

The system was developed as part of a Python & Machine Learning Internship and includes model explainability to ensure transparency and interpretability of predictions.
